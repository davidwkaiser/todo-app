# TodoApp

This project is based on this article from Sitepoint: https://www.sitepoint.com/angular-2-tutorial/

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## About Me
I am a graduate of Dev Bootcamp, I'm looking for my first dev job. I know Ruby / Rails, JavaScript / jQuery / AJAX, 
HTML / CSS, and SQL. I've used Ionic (Angular for mobile), but don't remember much about it. I'm teaching myself   
Node.JS and Angular 2. I recently attended Angular Summit 2017 and an Angular workshop / MeetUp, 
I'm serious about learning Angular 2.  

I'm a leader, I'm responsible, and I'm low drama.
